		ROOT CONFIGURATION
************************************************************************************

The root field CONFIGURATION contains system-wide configuration data. 
All values are preconfigured with reasonable defaults.

FIELD: logging="/path/to/logfile"    
Specify the location and name of the daemon logfile


FIELD: diff_log="/path/to/logfile"	
This is where differential notices will be logged

FIELD: logging_enabled="yes|no"         
Disable or enable logging
Values of false, no, 0, leaving it empty will disable 

FIELD: logging_verbose="yes|no"         
To disable or enable Verbose logging
Values of false, no, 0, leaving it empty will disable

FIELD: log_differential="yes|no"	
Enable to log differential notices 
Values of false, no, 0, leaving it empty will disable

FIELD: revision_depth="<num>"        
The number of configuration changes which will be stored in the tracking directory; 
a value of '5' means the last five configurations will be retained. The default 
is 30.

FIELD: iteration_frequency="<num>"   
The server will sleep for this many seconds between iterating through all 
monitored devices. Used to control iteration frequency.

FIELD: tracking="/path/to/tracking"  
This specifies the path of the directory used by snmpTastic to perform state 
tracking of monitored devices. This should be an empty directory somewhere on the 
local file system.

This directory and its contents are  critical to the proper functioning of 
snmptastic, and it also contains device configurations and should be set with 
secure permissions. 
 

FIELD: diff_command="/path/to/diff"	
This specifies the command and options  used when generating 'differential' notices. 
This can be any relevant UNIX command and should return NULL if no difference exists 
in configurations being evaluated.

The preconfigured default is /usr/bin/diff -wu

This global command can be overridden with device specific commands             -->

		TFTP SERVER CONFIGURATION
************************************************************************************

Syntax:

<tftp>
        <address>[LOCAL IP Address of TFTP server]</address>
        <directory>[LOCAL directory of TFTP server]</directory>
</tftp>

This section contains parameters used for retrieving Cisco configurations
There are two fields here, <address> and <directory>.

The field "<address>" should be a properly configured and unning TFTP
server on the same host which snmpTastic is running on. This information is 
given to the Cisco device being polled by SNMP and the device uses it to send 
a copy of its configuration back.

Generally this should be the IP address which snmpTastic is running on  
and must *not* be 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'

The field "<directory>" should be the TFTP server directory (typically
this is "/tftpboot" on most UNIX hosts by default). After a configuration
has been placed there, snmpTastic looks for it using the value in the
"<directory>" field and moves the file into it's own tracking directory,
as defined above.

It is important to understand that these configuration sections are
only relevant for Cisco monitored devices, they are not used for
types 'scp' or 'hp' or 'foundry'

		DEVICE CONFIGURATIONS
************************************************************************************                

This is the real core of snmptastic. A device consists of a number of fields,
Instruction snmptastic the type of device, where and how to retrieve its
configuration.

Every device must have a "name" field which uniquely identifies the device;
it may be the device hostname but need not be as this field is a label and is
not used for any networking.

Every device must have a "type" field which is used to perform the correct
configuration retrieval method for each known device type. The 'type' field
is not case sensitive.

Every device must have an "address" field which tells snmptastic the hostname
Or IP address to retrieve the configuration from.

There are currently four device types supported by snmpTastic. Templates are
provided for all of them. These types are:

************************************************************************************                

cisco - This is a Cisco IOS-based device, running IOS 12.0 or later, or
        CatOS version 8.4 or later.

	Fields:

		name		A unique identifier for the device

		address        	The IP address or hostname of the
                                device.

		community	The SNMP Community string configured on the
				device. This must be a Read-Write,
				unrestricted string.
		
		type		This is the device type. For Cisco devices
                                this should be "cisco"
 		
		notify		[OPTIONAL] Additional email addresses
				may be entered in this field for device
    				specific differential notifications.
     				Addresses entered here will be appended
     				to the global notifications configured
  				above. This is a mechanism by which
 				changes to specific devices can be sent to
 				specific individual(s) who are not in the
 				global notification list.

		diff_command	[OPTIONAL] Any device may have a specific
				differential command assigned to it. If a
				one is configured for a device, this overrides
				the global diff_command assigned above.
				This is a spawned, external command and so
				explicit path with options should be set, and
				it should return NULL if no difference is
				detected between two files being compares.
				This is a mechanism to allow for custom 
				diff commands, scripts, etc to be used for
				certain devices for which the global is
				not appropriate.

hp -	This is an HP ProCurve or similar device. It is not currently
	known which Firmware revisions support SNMP; but it has been
	confirmed that images as old as I.07.61 do support it, as well
	as all known newer released. The fields for this type of device
	are the exact same as those used for 'Cisco' except that the type
	must be defined as 'hp'

	Fields:

************************************************************************************                

foundry - This device type works for Foundry devices. 

	Fields:
	
		name		A unique identifier for the device

		address		The IP address or hostname of the device.

		community	The SNMP Community string configured on the
				device. This must be a Read-Write,
				unrestricted string.

				this must be "foundry"
		
		enable		This field is necessary to properly format a 
				request SNMP packet. If 'snmp-server pw-check'
				is enabled then this MUST be the enable pass.
				  
				If 'no snmp-server pw-check' is set, then
				this can be any non-null string.

************************************************************************************                

scp - 	Unlike the others, this method does not involve SNMP. It uses
	Secure Copy (scp) with SSH keys to perform secure authentication.
	This method is valid for any device which support SSH key
	authentication and supports SCP. Typically this will be UNIX
	based hosts and devices. The fields for this type are slightly
	different as additional information is required for SCP to retrieve
	a remote configuration without passwords. The administrator must set
	up SSH key authentication between hosts; snmptastic does not perform
	this function.

	Fields:

		name		A unique identifier for the device

		address		The IP address or hostname of the
                                device.

		sshkey		The path to the SSH identity file used to
                                authenticate with the remote device.

		sshuser		The username used to authenticate with the
                                remote device.

		file		The full path of the file to retrieve from
                                the remote device (firewall configuration,
                                Zebra configuration file, etc)

		type		This is the device type. For SCP-capable
                                devices this should be "scp"

		notify		[OPTIONAL] Additional email addresses
				may be entered in this field for device
				specific differential notifications.
				Addresses entered here will be appended
				to the global notifications configured
				above. This is a mechanism by which
				changes to specific devices can be sent to
				specific individual(s) who are not in the
				global notification list.

		diff_command	[OPTIONAL] Any device may have a specific
				differential command assigned to it. If a
				one is configured for a device, this overrides
				the global diff_command assigned above.
				This is a spawned, external command and so
				explicit path with options should be set, and
				it should return NULL if no difference is
				detected between two files being compares.
				This is a mechanism to allow for custom
				diff commands, scripts, etc to be used for
